Homework 4 by Jordan Triplett
Completed 08/06/2020

This assignment has us create a timed quiz that scores high scores in order to gauge the knowledge of any given user on the NBA.

As specified in the assignment, a timer begins counting down and a question is presented with clickable answer buttons once you hit the start button. Once you select an answer by clicking on the corresponding button, you are presented with another question and more answer choices. If you are incorrect, the timer, and subsequently your score, goes down by an extra ten seconds. Once you answer all questions, or if the timer hits 0 before then, the game is over and you can enter your name. Once you enter your name, it is stored locally along with your score. Have fun testing your knowledge!
